                    <p>each shoe is made up of three parts: the upper, the lining or sock, and outersole.
                        each of these are made from varing matriels, but each will be labeled with universal symbols to inform consumer what material their shoe is made of.
                        knowing these matirels can help you better understand your consumer's needs and better sell to their style.

                    <p>The upper is what is the portion that covers the whole top of the shoe. 
                        The most common upper on Converse shoes is a canvas. This canvas upper is lightweight and durable for any time of the year. 
                        Other popular upper textiles are leather, suede, rubber, nubuck-leather, peached-canvas, but you can make the upper just about out of any textiles. 
                        Converse has even found ways to reuse materials such as plastic, denim, and cotton to create eco-friendly uppers.</p>
                    <p>The upper is made up of different sections, starting with the vamp (front of the shoe from toe to laces), Quarter, and the heel. </p>

                    <p>Shoelaces are one of the most functional aspects of the shoe, and with laces coming in every color you could imagine they also allow one to be creative with their All-Stars. The classic shoelaces are a 100% woven polyester to make for a durable long-lasting lace.</p>
                    <p>Most laces will have plastic in the types making it easier to lace up, but keep your eyes out for more unique styles will come with rose gold or some metal on the tips for style.
