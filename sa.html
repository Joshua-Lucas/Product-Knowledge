                <h2>Shoe Overview</h2>
                <p>each shoe is made up of three backs parts: the upper, the lining or sock, and outersole.
                    each of these are made from varing matriels, but each will be labeled with universal symbols to inform consumer what material their shoe is made of.
                    knowing these matirels can help you better understand your consumer's needs and better sell to their style.
                    </p>
                    <p> the three most common symbols used are leather, textile and other matrieals. Converse's most common other material will be rubber, Converse has been famous since 1908 of having a rubber soled shoe. </p>

            <!--Upper-->
            <div class="upper" >
                <div>
                    <h2>upper</h2>
                    <p>The upper is what is the textile that covers the whole top of the shoe. 
                        The most common upper on Converse shoes is a canvas. This canvas upper is lightweight and durable for any time of the year. 
                        Other popular upper textiles are leather, suede, rubber, nubuck-leather, peached-canvas, but you can make the upper just about out of any textiles. 
                        Converse has even found ways to reuse materials such as plastic, denim, and cotton to create eco-friendly uppers.</p>
                    <p>The upper is made up of different sections, starting with the vamp (front of the shoe from toe to laces), Quarter, and the heel. </p>
